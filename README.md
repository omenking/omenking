## Free Cloud Certifications Video Courses

I create free cloud certification courses and I publish them to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp):

- GCP-CDL (Google Cloud Digital Leader)
- AZ-900 (Azure Fundementals)
- AZ-104 (Azure Administrator)
- SC-900 (Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals)
- DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals)
- AWS CFL-C01 (Certified Cloud Practitioner)
- AWS SAA-C01 (Solutions Architect Associate)
- AWS DVA-C01 (Developer Associate)
- AWS SOA-C01 (SysOps Administrator Associate)
- Hashicorp Terraform Associate
- and more!

The best way to support more free cloud certification courses is to purchase additional study material layered ontop of the free to watch video course at [ExamPro](https://www.exampro.co)
